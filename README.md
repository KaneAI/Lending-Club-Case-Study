## General Information
- This project was assigned by Upgrad as part of the Masters in AI and Machine learning programme
- The aim of the project was to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default.
- These indicators could then be used when setting interest rates and approving loans to reduce the risk of default.
- A dataset from the "Lending Club" containing records of previous loans was perovided
- The Lending Club is an organisation that matches people requesting loans with investors.
